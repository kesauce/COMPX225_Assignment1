        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>The UoW Jazz Ensemble is a group of musicians who jam out on special nights. We play and improvise classical jazz standards and other modern pieces. We are open to new members who would like to join the ensemble or if you're down to watch us perform, you are more than welcome to come along at The Don, 8pm every last Friday of the month. Every few weeks, we host jazz workshops where we teach the basics of how to improvise over a piece. The basic knowledge of playing an instrument is required to follow along the course. We also have practice jam sessions where we try new pieces and learn playing with other members.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you are interested in joining the ensemble, please contact Alexis in regards with your skill level and we will get back to you as soon as possible. You can reach us at 123-456-789 or email us at uowjazzensemble@waikato.ac.nz</p>
